_[MISC BUGS:]
trade: put good, init trade, change item trade is still active!
when changing bank slots, still apears the first slot items.
You can move anything to quiver, thought should be able to move only arrows.
spells like in x% will do smth --- all has 100% chance. 
When u give a consumeable item to some1-> he can't use it.
I learnt a bunch of spells from trainer then typed .start and they were all gone from spell book (had to relogin for it to come back)
Trainers -> should not have rank 1 spell of the spells that your char has on create. Will cause you not to be able to learn rank 2 spells like fireball.
If you AOE, near a player(not npc) of opposite faction, you do damage to him, even though he is not flagged for pvp.
When Disenchanting Instead of opening a loot window, it goes directly in ur backpack (though i like it more this way :P)
for instant spells: if u cast and move next moment-> it's interrupted though u can cast it wile running
Rest system: u relax instantly as soon as u enter inn,that's completly  wrong u must stay in itt for some time.
and u get tired very quickly ...too quickly
Hearthstone displays CURRENT location to teleport, but teleports to correct 1.
Queuing sessions is highly bugged (if you connect/disconnect many times in the queue, you add tons of ghost ppl that are NOT removed ...)


_[PROFESSION BUGS:]
you learn the profession, but not the basic recipes/stuff ...


_[PET BUGS:]
pet's spells do not work ->which spells
when pet attacks some1,u press follow, it comes you,then goes away to mob again
mana cost for pet summon is x% of BASE mana, not of total,not of current, so u can summon even with 1 mana
'train me' FOR PET TRAINERS button crashes server


_[AI BUGS:]
ai ignores m_runspeed


_[SPELLS BUGS:]
